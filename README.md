## Learning Objectives
This project was created as part of my journey to becoming a web developer. By building this Quiz App, I aimed to:

* Deepen my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* Practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and managing complex state in JavaScript.

* Implement responsive design for an optimal user experience across different devices.

I'm preparing to enter a formal web development training program in early 2025, and this project is a key step in my preparation.
